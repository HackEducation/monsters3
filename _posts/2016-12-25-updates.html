<p>The book has been submitted to <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/691935">Smashwords</a> for approval. (It's available for purchase there already, but once it's approved, Smashwords will help distribute it to other online retailers.) It's also available <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/uqxVR">on Gumroad for $4.99</a></p>

<p>Now onto the more tedious process of getting Amazon to approve a Kindle version...</p>
