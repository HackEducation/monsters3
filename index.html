<p>Once again, I have spent much of 2016 on the road, traveling and speaking extensively about education technology's histories, ideologies, and mythologies. <strong><em>The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology</em></strong> is a collection of about a dozen of those talks on topics ranging from pigeons to cyborgs.</p> 

<p>It's the third book in the "Monsters of Ed-Tech" series - a sequel to my 2014 book <em><a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> and to my 2015 book <em><a href="http://monsters2.hackeducation.com">The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em>.

<p>The book will be published at the end of December. This site will be updated with more details once I, ya know, finish the book.</p>
