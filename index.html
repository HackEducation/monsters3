<p>Once again, I have spent much of 2016 on the road, traveling and speaking extensively about education technology's histories, ideologies, and mythologies. <strong><em>The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology</em></strong>, a sequel to my 2014 book <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em> and to my 2015 book <em>The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</em>, is a collection of about a dozen of those talks on topics ranging from teaching machines to the technlogical imperialism.</p>

<p>The book will be published at the end of December. This site will be updated with more details once I, ya know, finish the book.</p>
