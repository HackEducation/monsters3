<p>Once again, I spent much of 2016 on the road, traveling and speaking extensively about education technology's histories, ideologies, and mythologies. <strong><em>The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology</em></strong> is a collection of about a dozen of those talks on topics ranging from pigeons to predicting the future.</p> 

<p>It's the third book in the "Monsters of Ed-Tech" series &#8211; a sequel to my 2014 book <em><a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> and to my 2015 book <em><a href="http://monsters2.hackeducation.com">The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em>.

<p>E-book versions are available for purchase via the usual online retailers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6KR81D">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/691935">Smashwords</a>. Even better: <strong>you can also buy from me directly <a href="https://gumroad.com/audreywatters#">via Gumroad</a></strong>. You can purchase the e-book there (a ZIP file that contains the MOBI, EPUB, and PDF versions) <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/uqxVR">for $4.99</a>.</p>

<p>A print version and an audiobook are coming soon. Or probably more accurately, hopefully someday.</p>
